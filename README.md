# The movies-filter üé•
Welcome to your Movies filter site

## Description üéûÔ∏è 
The webpage is an interactive application that allows you to filter and search for movies based on different parameters. Upon accessing the page, you will be greeted with a welcome section that briefly describes the functionality of the page.

The page features a query form that includes several fields, such as user ID, minimum rating, start date, and end date. Users can fill in these fields to perform a customized search for movies.

When the form is submitted, the handleSubmit function is triggered, which gathers the user-entered values and applies a series of filters based on them. These filters are applied to a list of movies and users stored in the code.

Once the filters are applied, movie cards corresponding to the obtained results are generated. Each card displays relevant information about the movie, such as the title, username, rating, user's email, and full address.

If no results matching the search criteria are found, a message indicating that no records were found is displayed.

#### Responsive Design & Mobile First

The web application is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring that it adapts and displays properly across various devices and screen sizes. The responsive design allows users to have an optimal viewing experience, whether they are accessing the application from a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

The development approach follows the "mobile first" principle, which means that the initial design and development efforts prioritize the mobile experience. By starting with mobile devices in mind, the application is optimized for smaller screens and slower connections, providing a seamless and efficient user experience on all devices.

The responsive design and mobile-first approach guarantee that users can access and interact with the application conveniently, regardless of the device they are using.

## To use the application, follow these steps: üçø
1. Access the website.
2. Click on the "Let's Filter" button to access the search form.
3. Fill out the form, keeping in mind that some fields are mandatory and must be filled. These fields may include User ID, Minimum Rating, Start Date, and End Date.
4. Once you have filled out the form, click on the "Consult" button to perform the search and apply the filters.
5. If there are movies that match your search criteria, cards with relevant information for each movie will be displayed.
6. If there are no matches, the page will inform you that no records were found.
7. If you want to perform a new search, you can click on the "Filter Again" button to go back to the form and start a new query.
